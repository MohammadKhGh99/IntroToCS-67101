Standalone testing instructions:

1. Place your python files in this directory.

2. Run 'python3 test.py ex7tests'

3. Run 'python3 filelist.py <zipfile>', where '<zipfile>'
   is the name of your file, to determine if you are missing
   files, or have extra files.

4. Running 'python3 test.py ex7tests <testname>' where '<testname>'
   is the name of a test will run only the test named "testname".

As the semester proceeds, you will learn how to modify these
files in order to run only some of the tests, or modify
them in ways that will help in debugging.
