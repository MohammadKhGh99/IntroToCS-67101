This program divided to two parts:
    The First One:
        A code that gets a sudoku borad and returns True if there is
        a solution for it and False if there is not.
        And it consists of three helper functions:

        1- find_pos_of_zero()
            This function return the place of the first zero that will find in
            the sudoku board, if there is not it returns (-1,-1).

        2- valid_option()
            This function checks if we can replace the zero with the number or
            not, according to the sudoku rules.

        3- sudoku_helper()
            In this function I did all the work in it and called it in the
            main function.

    The Second One:
        A code consists of 3 functions:
            1- print_k_subsets()
                This function prints all the subsets, as list, as long as k,
                and in range of {0,...,n-1}.
                * I have got help with helper function, print_k_helper().

            2- fill_k_subsets()
                This function fill a list with all the subsets, as list, as long as k,
                and in range of {0,...,n-1}, but returns anything.
                * I have got help with two helper functions, k_subsets_helper()
                ,and a function that returns list.

            3- return_k_subsets()
                This function fill a list with all the subsets, as list,
                as long as k, and in range of {0,...,n-1}, and return the list
                of lists.
                * I have got help with helper function,
                all_lists_no_arg_helper.


I got help from Tirgul 8 for solving the second part of the exercise.
