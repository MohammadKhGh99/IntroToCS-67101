the python file hangman.py starts the hangman game that known for everyone
the user starts to enter strings, if the string not lowercase English letter
a message appears for the wrong input, if the letter that entered is not
in the hidden word it will be added to the wrong guesses message, also if the
letter has been chosen and in pattern
the user can ask for hint
if the hangman has been hanged a message will appear for the failure of the
user, like this if the user won but another message
if the game ends two buttons will appear one for playing again and another
for no more games to exit the game.

section C-q1:
('apple','___l_','1')=='___l_': I chose this input because the function must
get a lowercase english letter, but here the letter is '1'.
('mohammad','___a__a_','m')=='m__amma_': I chose this input because the letter
'm' appears in the word more than one time.
('science','_c___c_','c')=='_c___c_': I chose this input because the letter
'c' is in pattern so the function will not add it again.
('orange','__ang_','o')=='__ang_': I chose this input because the letter 'o'
is in the word but the function didn't add it to the pattern.

section C-q2:
If I want to change the code to input the Hebrew letters, I will have to change
 the range that I put for the dictionary, and the conditional if to another
 that contains the unicode for the Hebrew letters.
