this code have a lot of function:
1-making a list from a file
2-making a matrix from a file
3-finding how much the words in the words list appeared in the matrix in a
specific directions

when we sum all the functions with each other we resulted in a game, to find
the words in matrix.

the function check() checks the inputs that i chose.
i chose these inputs because each one is in a different direction
