=====================================================

this program is mainly a game  we set, and it is called "asteroids".
the program has the screen, on the screen we can see everything, and mainly
playing the game. at the beginning we had the number of lives that lived, the
score that user have after shooting the asteroids, the ship,
the asteroids, and the torpedoes.

now to talk about each one of them:
score: the score is the users aim, so he will try getting the more points as
possible, the way the user will get the points is by shooting the the
asteroids, so shooting asteroids with size(3) the user gets 20 point,
shooting asteroids with size(2) the user gets 50 point, shooting
asteroids with size(1) the user gets 100 point.

lives: each time the user play he has  3 lives: the user will miss them after
a crash between the ship and the asteroids.

ship: the ship mainly represents the user, so the user controls the movements
of the ship, and from the ship the user can shoot (in specific conditions)
the asteroids and get the points.

asteroids: the asteroids is the objects in our game, and our goal is
to shoot them, after hitting the asteroid each time, the asteroid will
be divided(the first time it will be divided to two parts, the same for
the second time, the asteroid will be crashed if its size is 1.

torpedoes: torpedoes is our weapon in this game, the user fire it from our ship
and goes with a speed in one direction, and if it collide with the asteroid,
the asteroid will be divided.

so we have explain about the game, and how we can play it.

In this program wu used the private init instead of public, so we could use
the public because it is easier to code it. but the reason we used the private
is that no one can change values in it.3

we have done a special torpedo we set by pressing on the "s" and when the
torpedo hits the asteroids, the asteroid will be totally destroyed. and the
user have 5 special torpedoes to use in the game.
